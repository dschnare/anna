- refactor out usage of makeRecursiveDependencyAnalyzer
- all analyzers should have a 'kind' property set before registering with Anna
- add section to README:
  - analyzer result object must be an absolute file path or have the property
    'fileName' that is an absolute file path in order for recursive analysis to
    take place
